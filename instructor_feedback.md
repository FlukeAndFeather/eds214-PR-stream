## **Collaborate**

Peer feed back went well, where I received helpful feed back from Vedika on how to organize my data cleaning code. This was helpful as my paper.qmd is now clean and includes the most important parts of code needed for my analysis. Vedika provided suggestions on how to meet the intermediate output spec. I plan on doing this by saving my individual nutrient plots in my figs folder. Now that I resolved the issues that Vedika and myself made, I feel that I can add more detail to my README file. As I was providing feedback to Lucian, I made sure to make note of specs that were almost met and gave specific ideas of how the spec could be met or what was already done to partly meet the spec. I when reviewing Lucian's code I also noticed that he had a different number of observation values after joining his data and made sure he was aware of this through an issue I created in his repository.
