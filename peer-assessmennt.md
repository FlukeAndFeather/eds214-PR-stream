# peer- Assessment

## Automate

### [ ] **Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document**

-   Meets spec: Entire analysis runs properly without throwing errors.

### [ ] The analysis runs without errors

-   Meets spec: The analysis does not throw any errors. Averages are appropriately assigned to respective nutrients. NaN are thrown but are assumed to be a result of NA values resulting from the original sampling dataset.

### [ ] **The analysis produces the expected output**

-   Not yet?/Meets spec: The column has been created correctly and contains the associated nutrient concentration. NaNs are thrown but are assumed to be a result of NA values resulting from the original sampling dataset.

### [ ] **Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)**

-   Not yet: A script can be created to store and clean the dataset. This code is already seen in the "try2_fig3_remake.R" script in "scratch".

## **Organize**

### [ ] Raw data is contained in its own folder

-   Meets spec: All raw data is stored appropriately in a separate folder.

### [ ] Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data

-   Not yet: The figures can be stored in a separate folder (ex. "figs").

### [ ] **At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file**

-   Meets/Exceeds spec: The moving_avg function was stored separately and is sourced locally.

## **Document**

### [ ] The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

-   Not yet: Readme is currently a rough draft but will later build on the existing framework.

### [ ] **The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works**

-   Not yet: Flowchart can be added to explain thought process for analysis.

### [ ] **The code is appropriately commented**

-   Meets/exceeds spec: commenting is very detailed.

### [ ] **Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention**

-   Meets/exceeds spec: Variable names are appropriate and relate to each variable's purpose.

## **Scale**

### [ ] Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages

-   Meets/exceeds spec: All packages are appropriately stored and run.

### [ ] The analysis script runs without errors

-   Meets/exeeds spec: No errors thrown.
